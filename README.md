# Project2-Oxygen

## Project Name: 
The Holly Jolly Generator

## Motivation

Our motivation for creating the Holly Jolly Generator is to spread holiday cheer and joy in our communities during these difficult times, by creating an app that allows people to give gifts to less forutunate members of our communities, while saving time & phyiscal resources. 

## Method

Using full CRUD, we create our database by using ajax to target specific id elements within our handlebars and then in turn read it into our app, update our givers and recievers portion of our database using ajax to target on submit/click functions, and delete portions of our database when certain criterions are met. 

## Demonstration

## Technologies Used

API routes

MYSQL for databasing

Handlebars for our html

CSS for stylizing elements of handlebars
