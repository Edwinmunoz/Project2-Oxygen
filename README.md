# The Holly Jolly Generator

## Initial setup for local usage (installing npm packages):

In config folder, under config.json, replace username and password with your own mysql database username and password. In gitbash, run command npm install, and all node modules should be installed to your local instance. For MYSQL, insert data from Schema into local MYSQL instance and run code before starting the app.

## Motivation:

Our motivation for creating the Holly Jolly Generator is to spread holiday cheer and joy in our communities during these difficult times, by creating an app that allows people to give gifts to less forutunate members of our communities, while saving time & physical resources. 

## Method:

Using full CRUD, we create our database by using ajax to target specific id elements within our handlebars and then in turn read it into our app, update our givers and receivers portion of our database using ajax to target on submit/click functions, and delete portions of our database when certain criterions are met.
